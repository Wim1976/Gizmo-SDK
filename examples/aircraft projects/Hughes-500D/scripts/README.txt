The Hughes 500D Helicopter project was a collaboration between Alex Gifford, Brett Sumpter and Ben Russell.
It featured a custom plugin that provided new levels of animation detail and articulation.
Now, a few years later, I have ported the plugin to Lua scripts to demonstrate their potential as a real solution.
The source code has been separated into various modules to make re-use more practical.
